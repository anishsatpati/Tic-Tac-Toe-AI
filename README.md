# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Tic Tac Toe playing AI using Python
Tic-Tac-Toe is also known as Xs and Os, and is a two player game. In this project, we build an AI to play as one player against a human player. The AI will find the most optimal move at each chance, looking at the current state of the board, and the different moves possible to reach the end. For this purpose, the first thing that may come to your mind is that the AI can look for all the possible moves and their paths to the end, and then choose a path which may result in its victory. Again, this has to be done at every chance where the AI has to plan. It is obvious that this is not the right approach since the run-time of a single game will be huge! Thus, we will implement the MiniMax algorithm in Python, which is much more optimised. As an extra task, we can also implement Alpha-Beta pruning, which is an optimisation for the MiniMax alorithm, resulting in an even lower run-time at each step where the AI has to make a move.
